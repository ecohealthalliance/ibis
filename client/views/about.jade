      IBIS is a system for monitoring infectious disease bio-events that threaten
      the international flight network.
      The system runs simulations based on current and future flight schedules to estimate
      flows of passengers between airports.
      This is combined with a system that extracts the dates and locations of
      disease cases from mentions on ProMED-mail to identify locations
      in the US that diseases are more likely to reach through the flight network.

      __IBIS is currently under development. The information that is currently
      displayed may be mock data__

      ## Threat Level

      The threat level is based on a rough approximation of the number of incoming infected passengers.
      It is computed as follows:
      
      __ThreatLevel__(event, inboundAirport) =  *sumOverAirports*[ __EstimatedPassengerFlow__(airport, inboundAirport) * __ProbabilityPassengerInfected__(event, airport) ]
      
      __ProbabilityPassengerInfected__(event, departureAirport) = __CurrentNumberInfectedInAirportCatchment__(event, departureAirport) / __CatchmentPopulation__(departureAirport)
      
      __CatchmentPopulation__(airport) = Population of airport's country

      __CurrentNumberInfectedInAirportCatchment__(event, airport) = Cumulative cases in airport's country over last two weeks
