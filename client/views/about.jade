      IBIS is a system for monitoring infectious disease bio-events that threaten
      the international flight network.
      The system runs simulations based on current and future flight schedules to estimate
      flows of passengers between airports.
      This is combined with a system that extracts the dates and locations of
      disease cases from mentions on ProMED-mail to identify locations
      in the US that diseases are more likely to reach through the flight network.

      __IBIS is currently under development. The information that is currently
      displayed may be mock data__

      # Simulations
      
      Passengers are simulated over time intervals starting in the last 24 hours
      through the following two weeks. [The simulator source code is available here.](https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/flirt-simulation-service)

      # Bioevent Data
      
      Bioevent data is automatically extracted by [EIDR-Connect](https://eidr-connect.eha.io).

      ## Threat Exposure
      The overall levels of risk all bioevents throughout the world pose to
      U.S. destinations.

      ## Estimated Inbound Passenger Flow
      The total number of passengers estimated to arrive at each U.S. destination.

      # International

      ## Estimated Passenger Flow by Origin
      The approximate number of people from each country of origin that arrive at the target
      location as their terminal destination.
      
      ## Direct Flow by Origin
      The number of seats available on direct flights arriving at the target location.

      ## Threat Level by Origin
      The esimated risk of any bioevent spreading from each country of origin
      to the target location.

      ## Threat Level

      The threat level is based on a rough approximation of the number of incoming infected passengers.
      It is computed as follows:
      
      __ThreatLevel__(event, inboundAirport) =  *sumOverAirports*[ __EstimatedPassengerFlow__(airport, inboundAirport) * __ProbabilityPassengerInfected__(event, airport) ]
      
      __ProbabilityPassengerInfected__(event, departureAirport) = __CurrentNumberInfectedInAirportCatchment__(event, departureAirport) / __CatchmentPopulation__(departureAirport)
      
      __CatchmentPopulation__(airport) = Population of airport's country

      __CurrentNumberInfectedInAirportCatchment__(event, airport) = Cumulative cases in airport's country over last two weeks

      ## Ex. US
      
      The Ex. US versions of rank metrics exclude the United States as a source
      of incoming threats.
